AMP technology has gained its fame as a solution that allows you to make websites as fast as possible. Search engines reward fast sites. The faster the site, the higher its ranking on Google.

 ## Why is AMP so important?

                                                      
Google search results contain much more than just a list of links. They are made from different elements: snippets, featured snippets, rich snippets, carousels, knowledge graph, cards etc.  Google uses these elements (SERP features or SERP Panels) to show you information when you enter a query. 


 Whether you like it or not, but most of the web pages that get clicks from SERP panels are AMP pages. 
Don’t believe? Just enter a popular search query in the browser of your mobile device. Then click  on  any site from the top, you will find the abbreviation ‘AMP’ in their URLs

What it means is that this page has reached the top of search results pages with the AMP technology. 



## How does AMP work? 




There are currently three approaches to work with the AMP technology:


### 1) Automatic Approach - Conversion


Many website builders offer automatic AMP conversions to their clients.  The disadvantage of this approach is that, automatic conversion in order to improve SEO performance can easily break things. For example, a photo gallery might not work correctly or the AMP version of a page might not have a comments section. 



### 2) Coding AMP components 


The easiest way to code all AMP features correctly is to use the AMP component catalog. From small things to complex ones like web stories, AMP built-in components are the building blocks for AMP pages. The page can be made entirely from the components or only partially. 
Here is a real-world example:

{{< img class="img-small" src="images/2.gif"    >}}

Without switching completely to AMP, the Ebay store uses the AMP- carousel with horizontal scrolling.
In the below image, we see how ebay is using AMP component: a horizontally scrolling carousel.

The AMP library  includes components for various tasks, like adding images, displaying ads and configuring webpage.


### 3) Duplicating Approach content in AMP 


The  third and most popular way to work with AMP is content duplication. Not all website builders allow automatic AMP conversion, and even if they do, not everyone wants to solve possible design problems. 
Pages with particularly important  SEO  content  can be duplicated in AMP. 
So, your search traffic will be particularly relevant to the best that the site has to offer.
