At first glance, web stories and social media stories look almost the same,  but they are not . 

<!--more-->
 1) Web stories appear directly on Google search results. They can be indexed and  can be found. While social media stories can only be available to the users of the network that allow them to create stories. 

2) There is no expiration date for web stories. Only the owners of web stories decide how long they will last and be stored. Instagram, for example, has a limit: the duration of stories is 60 seconds and their lifespan is only 24 hours. 

3) Links and CTA buttons can be used in web stories. On Instagram, including links is only available to the users who have more than ten thousand subscribers.


4) Unlike social media stories, when you include ads in your Web Stories, 100% of ads revenue goes to you. 

This list could be expanded, but in my opinion, these four points are enough to illustrate the key differences between web-stories and stories from social media networks.
