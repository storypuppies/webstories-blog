1)	Web stories are only indexed in English-language. 
<!--more--> 
2)	Likes functionality  is under development.


3) Developers have to research and experiment a lot for themselves. Relevant information is scattered across the forums and GitHub pages. For example, [StackOverflow ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73136272/custom-javascript-in-amp-stories ) is a common place to search for answers but receiving a link to the incomplete documentation is not really helpful. The question was downvoted. I was exploring the same question and started with the documentation. In this case it didn't provide enough details.

 
5) Google Cash for Web Stories is now live! Google now provides support for video caching to all Web Stories. You just need to add one  tag:



   ``` <amp-video cache="google"...>  ```
