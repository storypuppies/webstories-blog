Some ten years ago, the UX of Google search results looked like that:
 <!--more-->

It was a uniform list of links to external websites. Over time, the design of search results has changed. Google added additional features, called SERP Panels. SERP panels contain much more than links. Users can see information about their query, get links to related queries and even see relevant social media posts. 





 ### Медиа блоки

Медиа блоки представляют собой карусель карточек, отоброжающая видео или фотографии, как наилучший ответ на запрос пользователя.

### Google's Knowledge Panels 

If you enter the name of a celebrity, then most likely the search engine will display a knowledge panel. You’ll often see them when you look for information about a famous person.

Usually they include a brief description of the topic, images, reviews, and links to related search topics.

In my opinion, Knowledge Panel is the most incomprehensible SERP feature,  since the documentation says that it may even include  posts from social networks and advertising. 
But it is not clear whether it is only in the plans or has already been implemented.




### News Panels 


This panel is a carousel of cards showing news related to a search query. For a website snippet to be included in  News Panels, it has to fulfil a lot of technical and qualitative criteria. 
News Panels are almost 100% filled with news from mass media sites (authoritative sources of news).

### Featured snippets 


Featured Snippets are boxes of information that appear at the top of the search results. It’s a quick way  to obtain contextually relevant information without needing to  dive too in-depth.

### Sitelinks



Everything is simple here.  Sitelinks are additional links which appear beneath the main URL for a brand  when you search for it on Google. They are designed by Google to help users navigate your site.
