In my article, I am going to talk about the connection between UX-design and culture.
The culture and UX-design have a direct connection between each other. 

 Different cultures have different values. UX is the visual language that changes from country 
 to country.
 In my constantly updated post, I am going to try to answer the following questions:
  
What is the cultural impact of the country on its design?
What are the most common colors used in the designs?
How typography and  the visual hierarchy are presented in the designs?


We need to understand the visual language and culture impact on design 
and what are the common colors used in designs to design to the peoples needs.



We always think that beautiful design can make people happy but the most important thing is that 
design should be relevant to the visual language of its culture and time. 


The timeless designs are always inspired by culture. 

we do a design which is relevant and talk to the people we are designing for.

to the current trends, be timeless, and most importantly demonstrate �design thinking� or
 a solution-based thinking for an improved UX.
