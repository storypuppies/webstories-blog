In a [previous post](/en/evaluate),  I reviewed the new Google Metrics designed to measure the quality of a website.Continuing to research the topic, I want to explain a few things that I have learned while exploring approaches to measuring website performance. 




 ## Synthetic monitoring 

 These tools are programs that collect data about the performance of a website. They scan your site and gives you the detailed report, from which you can find out how fast the site is and what you can do to speed it up.

It was a surprise for me to find out that most of the improvements are related to the frontend. 
Web-performance site guru, Steve Sounders claims that 80-90% of loading time is spent on the front-end.

Perhaps in 2021 the ratio has changed. However, there are still a lot of sites that use obsolete  formats  or poorly compressed media.

>  Image compression has continued to evolve. New formats have been introduced that provide a rich feature set while minimizing bandwidth. -  Crocker C.


 ## Real User Monitoring  

Speeding up a website is no easy task.  Your  problem could be anything from code to large page elements.  The services of the companies that provide this type of monitoring  are quite expensive.

 I prefer synthetic monitoring, but when my knowledge is not enough, an  real user monitoring and expert's help  are indispensable.
